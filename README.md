# Pomodivity

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.

## What is this?

A timer to be used with the pomodoro technique - Intervall of work, followed by a short break.
Repeated for a few times, then long instead of short break.

Default values of timers can be changed via Settings button

Timer can be paused

## To Do

- actual timer functionality lol
- settings functionality
- colors

## Future hopes

- redesign (currently a copy of [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/))
- animation: timer intervall display buttons dissapear after timer has started, color changes(?), timer enlarges?
