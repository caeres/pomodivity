<!-- Parts of this component:
+ Buttons to swap between the intervals -> These would prolly make sense to be designed as components (would be reusable in larger projects)
+ Timer -> No extra component, even if I expand on this project, I dont see any reason to need more than one timer
+ Button to start timer -> No extra component, only one in use? 

I want to slighty change the design tho, maybe buttons to the side and they disappear with an animation when you start the timer, while the timer gets somewhat larger? 
(I would like to get away from blatantly copying pomofocus.io lmao)-->

<div class="box-wrapper">
    <div class="timer-display">
        <div class="timer-settings">
            <app-timer-button [label]="pomodoroLabel" (click)="onClickPomodoro()"></app-timer-button>
            <app-timer-button [label]="shortBreakLabel" (click)="onClickShort()"></app-timer-button>
            <app-timer-button [label]="longBreakLabel" (click)="onClickLong()"></app-timer-button>
        </div>
        <div class="timer">
            {{timer.currentTimeMs|date:"mm:ss"}}
        </div> 
        <!-- evtl mit dem animierten progress bar -->
        <!-- <mat-progress-bar mode="determinate" [value]="40"></mat-progress-bar>  -->
        <div class="btn-start-wrapper">
            <button [ngClass]="bigButtonClass" (click)="onClickStartButton()">{{startButtonLabel}}</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
