<!-- In theory using a component for a header in a single page website is probably overkill
However I might expand on this page in some form or another and thus it could be reused
The structure will probably stay as before and thus be lacking in flexibility, but idc rn -->

<header class="header-wrapper">
    <div class="header-title" >Pomodovity</div>
    <!-- class="header-btn" -->
    <button mat-raised-button  (click)="openDialog()">Settings</button>
</header>
